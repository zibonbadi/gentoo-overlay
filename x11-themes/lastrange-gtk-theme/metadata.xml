		A clean, simple GTK/XFCE theme for easy and focused computing. Originally
		developed for dogfooding, the theme aims to be simple in both design and
		implementation while keeping a distinctly Unix-like aesthetic ...with
		some modern quality-of-life considerations.

		The name is a reference to Tom LaStrange, the inventor of the TWM window
		manager, which served as the main inspiration for the desktop theme.
		Other influences include printed paper, the Athena widget library and
		the Amiga Workbench
