# Contributing to the `zibonbadi` repository

This document outlines some guidelines for you to follow if you wanna
contribute code, issues, testing or whatever. These basic guidelines should be
familiar if you've already worked with software before.

## General 

This repository/overlay is just a personal project created out of my own needs
as a programmer and Gentoo Linux user. As such I will be the ultimate authority
on what is hosted on the main branch and what isn't.

Avoid swearing, insults, and similar unprofessional behavior. Keep in mind
that this is a publicly accessible forum with many more readers than authors. Try to be at least *somewhat* mature here.

### Issues

I highly encourage you to file issues if you encounter technical problems with
the repository.

Keep the issues topical and tag them appropriately. If there may be more to it,
try splitting the problem into multiple issues and cross-reference them using
links.

Try to document errors in a reproducable way. Everyone would like to help, but
if we can't analyze the error, we can't fix it. It may just be how you set up
your system.

Avoid duplicates. If you see one, refer to the original.

### Requests

You may file requests, but don't expect me to incorporate them. In general,
Requests should be made for resolving an existing issue and there may be
multiple solutions for one.

Always keep your code on feature branches. `main` is for syncing the system.

## Notes for `games-arcade/srb2`

Since to my current knowledge this repository hosts the only Sonic Robo Blast 2
Ebuild anyone was actually bothered to write, I would happily step up as the
quasi-maintainer for SRB2 on Gentoo. However, since I otherwise barely interact
with the game's community, here are some of the ways to contact me about
potential issues/ideas regarding the ebuild `games-arcade/srb2`:

Suggested ways of contacting me (in descending order):

1. GitHub issues
1. Pull requests
3. Randomly catching me on a netgame

Don't even think about contacting me through:

1. Direct Messages on Discord (I will block you)
2. The official SRB2 Discord server (I rarely visit it and the more @mentions I
   get, the more kittens I'm gonna strangle in your sleep)
3. [The official Sonic Robo Blast 2 message board](https://mb.srb2.org/)
   (I neither have an account nor actually visit this place)

Also keep in mind that I am not part of the actual game's development team.
This repository and it's community are merely focused on getting this game to
run "the Gentoo way" without having to resort to manual compilations or messy
installs. If you wanna moan about the game itself, I suggest 
[the official Sonic Robo Blast 2 message board](https://mb.srb2.org/).
