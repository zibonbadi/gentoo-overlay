# Gentoo Overlay

This is a personal repository of ebuilds to cleanly install various stuff I use. You may find it useful as well.

## Installation

You run Gentoo, you *know* what you're doing. If not, lemme save you some time and redirec you to [the Steam overlay Wiki page](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Steam) for an example on how to install overlays.
